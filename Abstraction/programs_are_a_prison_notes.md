# Programs are a prison: Rethinking the fundamental building blocks of computing interfaces

__Conway's Law:__ th structure of a software reflects the social structure the software exists within\
_Example:_ corporate websites being highly hierarchical.

### Criticism
- Strong case: sometimes the constraint specification cannot be generalised, it is specific by definition
- Weaker Case: A generalised constraint specification is unoptimised. Instagram do not want the generalised image object. Their image object may be very wildly different from a general image object. 
- this is something that needs to be build specifically. The default, minimum viable implementation will rarely include this kind of functionality easily, hence it is not very to build this for objects where most users do not need to interact in this way.

## Notes
- is this just a top down rephrase that things should be 'hackable'
- generally in support. The source code of humanity should be available to everyone. 
- The internet is the closest thing to a unified environment. Everything should be web based.
